## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://www.wsb-nlu.edu.pl/)

Who I am? What's my mission?

Here's why:
* Path (simple codes) contains source codes for programs that were executed in the exercises and individually outside the exercises.
* The codes are a solution to exercises given by the lecturer.
* The codes are my interpretation and vision for solving the task - there may be other (easier) solutions.
* The univeristy assignment track is a kind of diary that contains my development in the field of programming     depending on the programming language.  
* There will be no exam tasks in the source codes
* I reserve the right not to contact people who ask about the details of the codes, or how to do something - the soluction is always simple. Read the book or visit stackoverflow
